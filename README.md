This repository demonstrates a common error in Dart asynchronous programming: improper exception handling in HTTP requests.  The `bug.dart` file shows code that fails to handle 404 errors distinctly from other network or JSON parsing exceptions.  The `bugSolution.dart` file provides a corrected version with improved exception handling and specific 404 error management.  This example highlights the importance of robust error handling to maintain application stability and provide informative feedback to the user.
